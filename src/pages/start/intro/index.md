# What is PWA Studio?

Introduce Studio in the simplest of terms: PWA Studio is a toolkit/library/framework for creating the best PWAs for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source sites. The repo's README.md file provides something similar, but the docs do not.

## Concepts

- Show a diagram that introduces the PWA Studio tech stack. The diagram should show how the parts of PWA Studio are connected to each other, how those parts connect to Adobe Commerce (Magento), and how the data flows from Magento to PWA Studio apps to Users in order to provide the best PWAs for Adobe Commerce (Magento).

- The parts / tools within PWA Studio should be briefly described below the diagram, focusing on it's purpose within the Studio framework.

- The third-party technologies — React, GraphQL, UPWARD, Redux — used in the framework should be identified and distinquished from our home-grown PWA Studio code — Venia, Peregrine, Talons, etc.

- Why PWA Studio? Very briefly callout the key advantages of using PWA Studio over other solutions. If the reasons are explicit and compelling enough (after showing how PWA Studio works), then this topic will help set the tone and give developers/partners a reason to invest their time and energy into learning PWA Studio and reading the docs.

## Keyboard

- Add links to the best 3-4 sites created with PWA Studio and callout at least one compelling area of the site that illustrates the case for using PWA Studio.
