# Set up PWA Studio

This is a critically important topic, which could be expanded into a section if needed. As the saying goes, you're only as good as your tools. And when you feel confident that you're using the best tools – on a solid "workbench" (environment) – your motivation grows, your confidence increases, and good feelings carry you into the challenges ahead.

## Concepts

- Show a diagram that displays the project structure for the Venia sample app as it would appear in VS Code. Position the project structure in the center surrounded by callouts that describe the setup steps and installed tools required to get the project building and live reloading during development.

- Describe the parts in the diagram with a focus on the development function it provides.

## Keyboard

- Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up the Venia app as shown in the diagram.

- Include the use or alternate use of using the PWA scaffolding tool to setup a new project.

- Identify, use, and provide examples for when to use the `package.json scripts` provided with the Venia sample project.

- Include a setup validation exercise (via one or more of the scripts) so that all the common setup problems can be fixed before they start development in the first tutorials.
